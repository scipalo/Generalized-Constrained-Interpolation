# Generalized-Constrained-Interpolation

Generalized Constrained Interpolation is a project for masters degree. Its main topic is image magnification with interpolation methods. 
First goal is to implement algorithm described in "Generalized Constrained Interpolation" paper.

Material in main repository:
* **Code in progress** contains latest version of code in progress.
* **Scripts for examination** contains executable scripts meant for analising specific problems.
* Paper **Generalized Constrained Interpolatio** is the main paper with description of the algotithm for implemetnation.
* Paper **Constrain based interpolation** is the base paper for "Generalized Constrained Interpolation"
* In **Progress description** I presented results of written code and zet unsolved problems.
